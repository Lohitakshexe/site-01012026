i
 
know
 
u
 
already
 
kinda
 
know
 
but
 
I
 
still
 
want
 
to
 
reassure
 
u,,i
 
don't
 
think
 
in
 
the
 
bad
 
way
 
at
 
all,
 
i
 
never
 
want
 
to,
 
idk
 
how
 
to
 
make
 
u
 
believe
 
but....
 
I'm
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
'hold
 
hands',
 
long
 
walks
 
and
 
hugger
 
type
 
of
 
guy,
 
although
 
I
 
haven't
 
hugged
 
a
 
human
 
in
 
6-7
 
years(I'm
 
not
 
indirectly
 
askig
 
u
 
for
 
a
 
hug),
 
contradicting
 
but
 
yea
 
that's
 
how
 
it
 
is,
 
i
 
stopped
 
when
 
i
 
realised
 
it
 
was
 
always
 
me
 
offering
 
hugs,idk
 
how
 
to
 
make
 
u
 
believe
 
me,
 
I
 
cannot
 
prove
 
it,
 
but
 
if
 
u
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
trust
 
me
 
on
 
this,
 
i
 
don't
 
want
 
sympathy
 
or
 
empathy
 
at
 
all,
 
that's
 
not
 
what
 
I
 
seek,
 
i
 
wanted
 
to
 
tell
 
u
 
all
 
this
 
so
 
that
 
u
 
don't
 
feel
 
bad
 
and
 
uncomfortable
 
with
 
me,
 
if
 
it
 
goes
 
that
 
way,
 
tell
 
me
 
directly,
 
i
 
want
 
ruthlessness
 
there.
 
idk
 
if
 
u
 
will
 
ever
 
read
 
this
 
but
 
I
 
feel
 
better
 
after
 
writing
 
it
 
down.i
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
why
 
I'm
 
stressing
 
on
 
this
 
so
 
much,
 
maybe
 
i
 
just
 
care
 
too
 
much,
 
i
 
still
 
don't
 
know
 
myself,
 
ur
 
the
 
moon
 
in
 
my
 
hella
 
like
 
life,u
 
shine
 
brighter
 
than
 
the
 
sun,
 
i
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
hold
 
u
 
back,
 
i
 
just
 
give
 
the
 
edge
 
bcz
 
i
 
to
 
anyone,
 
i
 
don't
 
want
 
u
 
to
 
adapt
 
to
 
anything,
 
stupid
 
me
 
fk
 
this
 
life,
 
i
 
've
 
been
 
ruining
 
myself
 
since
 
so
 
long,
 
I
 
Just
 
can't
 
stop,I'm
 
always
 
trying
 
to,
 
but
 
I
 
can't
 
stop,
 
i
 
have
 
people
 
who
 
can
 
listen,
 
but
 
ur
 
just
 
different,
 
u
 
..*stutters*,
 
alr
 
i
 
don't
 
have
 
better
 
word
 
than
 
this,
 
u
 
unravel
 
me,
 
the
 
word
 
ain't
 
accurate
 
but
 
the
 
closest
 
to
 
this
 
feeling.
 
I
 
m
 
scared,
 
u
 
will
 
get
 
so
 
attached
 
to
 
me
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
hinder
 
u
 
and
 
if
 
it
 
goes
 
completely
 
opposite
 
which
 
I
 
think
 
is
 
more
 
likely,
 
then
 
u
 
will
 
feel
 
really
 
bad
 
in
 
telling
 
that
 
to
 
me,
 
i
 
don't
 
want
 
u
 
to
 
suffocate,
 
it's
 
very
 
very
 
bad,
 
pls
 
just
 
say
 
whatever
 
u
 
feel,
 
 
never
 
do
 
anything
 
*just*
 
for
 
me,
 
never
 
pls
