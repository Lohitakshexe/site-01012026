she
 
just
 
told
 
me
 
about
 
how
 
she
 
was
 
scolded
 
alot
 
and
 
her
 
parents
 
were
 
tuff
 
on
 
her,
 
i
 
have
 
doubted
 
the
 
scars
 
behind
 
this
 
happy
 
face
 
along
 
time
 
ago,
 
but
 
i
 
dropped
 
it.
 
wow,
 
she
 
really
 
is
 
adorable,
 
omg,
 
i
 
love
 
her
 
even
 
more.
 
she
 
was
 
troubled,
 
i
 
m
 
not
 
sure
 
how
 
much
 
yet,
 
i
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
know
 
to
 
be
 
honest
 
but
 
i
 
don't
 
think
 
i
 
will
 
talk
 
about
 
it
 
alot.
 
she
 
was
 
hiding
 
this
 
till
 
now,
 
its
 
been
 
2
 
months,
 
i
 
feel
 
ashamed
 
to
 
not
 
know
 
that
 
she
 
was
 
so
 
troubled
 
back
 
in
 
the
 
day.
 
i
 
noticed
 
it
 
but
 
i
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
i
 
let
 
that
 
slide,
 
i
 
hate
 
myself
 
for
 
that.
 
how
 
the
 
fuck
 
can
 
i
 
not
 
notice,
 
that
 
was
 
me
 
being
 
selfish
 
sub-consciously.
 
 
i
 
just
 
realised
 
while
 
talking
 
to
 
her
 
that
 
she
 
is
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
express
 
herself
 
very
 
well.
