talk
 
to
 
me,
 
let
 
her
 
ask
 
anything
 
she

me
 
updated
 
on
 
everything,

me
 
know
 
what
 
the
 
situation

and
 
talk
 
to
 
your
 
dad,
 
he
 
may
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
calm
 
her
 
down,
 
show
 
her
 
a
 
different
 
perspective,
 
help
 
her
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
situation
 
with
 
a
 
open
 
mind
 
ready
 
to
 
receive
 
a
 
few
 
ideas
 
and
 
take
 
the
 
doubtful
 
thoughts
 
out
 
of
 
her.
 
*if
 
only
 
somehow,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
way,
 
to
 
make
 
her
 
communicate
 
openly,
 
ask
 
everything*
 
 
and
 
whatever
 
happens,
 
i
