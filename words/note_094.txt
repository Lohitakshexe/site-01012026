But
 
jokes
 
aside…
 
I
 
don’t
 
think
 
you
 
even
 
realize
 
how
 
much
 
I
 
love
 
you.
 
Like,
 
seriously.
 
It’s
 
unfair
 
how
 
much
 
space
 
you
 
take
 
up
 
in
 
my
 
mind
 
and
 
my
 
heart.
 
You
 
make
 
people
 
feel
 
seen,
 
heard,
 
and
 
cared
 
for......especially
 
me.
 
You
 
bring
 
this
 
warmth,
 
this
 
comfort,
 
this
 
happiness
 
that
 
I
 
never
 
even
 
knew
 
I
 
needed.
 
You
 
make
 
the
 
smallest
 
moments
 
feel
 
magical.
 
💙
 
 
And
 
no
 
matter
 
how
 
many
 
birthday
 
wishes
 
you
 
get
 
today,
 
just
 
remember......mine
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
special.
 
Why?
 
Because
 
I
 
mean
 
it
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
no
 
one
 
else
 
ever
 
could.
 
I
 
don’t
 
just
 
wish
 
for
 
your
 
happiness
 
today....I
 
wish
 
for
 
it
 
every
 
single
 
day.
 
I
 
wish
 
for
 
every
 
dream
 
of
 
yours
 
to
 
come
 
true,
 
for
 
every
 
moment
 
to
 
be
 
filled
 
with
 
love
 
(especially
 
mine
 
😉
),
 
and
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
always
 
know
 
how
 
deeply
 
you’re
 
adored.
 
 
And
 
most
 
of
 
all…
 
I
 
wish
 
for
 
us.
 
For
 
you
 
and
 
me
 
to
 
stay
 
together......not
 
just
 
for
 
today,
 
not
 
just
 
for
 
this
 
year,
 
but
 
for
 
every
 
year
 
to
 
come.
