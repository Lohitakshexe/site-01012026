its
 
funny
 
how
 
i
 
only
 
felt
 
her
 
as
 
good
 
frnd
 
warmth,
 
then
 
slid
 
into
 
'lovely
 
frnd',
 
then
 
denied
 
that
 
i
 
could
 
have
 
a
 
crush
 
on
 
her,
 
then
 
i
 
finally
 
did
 
accept
 
it.
 
i
 
found
 
perfection
 
in
 
her,
 
her
 
words,
 
already
 
were
 
soo
 
magical,
 
her
 
smile
 
turned
 
magical,
 
and
 
now,
 
everything
 
abt
 
her
 
is
 
enchanting,
 
i
 
fell
 
in
 
love
 
with
 
her
 
core
 
sooo
 
deeply,
 
my
 
head
 
was
 
cloudy
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
thoughts
 
of
 
'i
 
m
 
bad'
 
'shes
 
soo
 
good'
 
'shess
 
lovely'
 
'shes
 
better
 
off
 
without
 
me'
 
'i
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
tell
 
her
 
someday
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
let
 
go,
 
if
 
i
 
can'.
 
i
 
love
 
her
 
soo
 
muchh,
 
i
 
will
 
never
 
leave
 
her.
 
 
 
i
 
'd
 
give
 
up
 
the
 
world
 
for
 
u,
 
live
 
with
 
u
 
in
 
the
 
void
