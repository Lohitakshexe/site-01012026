u
 
have
 
to
 
go
 
:tears:,
 
uk
 
behind
 
that
 
"k",
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
'ahaaaaaaaaa,
 
pls
 
stay
 
with
 
meeeeeeeeee',
 
i
 
love
 
u
 
and
 
i
 
can't
 
stop
 
loving
 
u,
 
whenever
 
i
 
stop,
 
i
 
feel
 
like
 
im
 
not
 
doing
 
a
 
involuntary
 
action,
 
as
 
if
 
im
 
resisting
 
a
 
involuntary
 
action
 
and
 
i
 
m
 
reminded
 
of
 
it
 
each
 
moment.
 
i
 
did
 
not
 
talk
 
to
 
u
 
for
 
so
 
long
 
and
 
then
 
i
 
was
 
overwhelmed
 
when
 
u
 
were
 
back,
 
ofc,
 
u
 
saw
 
that
 
in
 
my
 
msgs.
 
i
 
did
 
not
 
care
 
abt
 
being
 
cringe
 
or
 
sounding
 
stupid
 
in
 
that
 
moment,
 
only
 
thing
 
i
 
can
 
think
 
about,
 
is
 
u.
 
i
 
get
 
a
 
different
 
energy
 
whenever
 
i
 
talk
 
to
 
u.
 
this
 
instant
 
is
 
unmatched,
 
but
 
then
 
u
 
say
 
that
 
u
 
have
 
to
 
go,
 
i
 
can't
 
help
 
but
 
say
 
"k",
 
cz
 
i
 
cannot
 
control
 
it
 
unfortunately.
 
i
 
love
 
u
 
and
 
i
 
will
 
always
 
love
 
uuuuu
