her
 
so
 
muchhhhhh
 
:tears:,
 
i

obsessed
 
and
 
addicted
 
to
 
her,
 
i
 
just
 
love
 
her,
 
omgggggggg,
 
i
 
feel
 
like
 
crying.
 
if
 
i
 
met
 
her
 
rn
 
suddenly,
 
i
 
would
 
literally
 
hug
 
her
 
so
 
tightly
 
and
 
cry
 
so
 
hard. 
 
i
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
with
 
her,
 
i
 
m
 
hugging
 
the
 
pillow
 
again
 
and
 
again
 
cz
 
she's
 
not
 
here.
 
they
 
say
 
"u
 
love
 
interest
 
when
 
u
 
don't
 
meet
 
enough",
 
fk
 
them
 
dammit.

for
 
her
 
deeper
 
and
 
deeper,
 
its

rn
 
and
 
it
 
feels
 
like
 
it
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
day
 
or
 
two
 
since
 
i
 
had
 
a
 
chat
 
with
 
her.
 
today
 
morning
 
she
 
msged
 
me,
 
but
 
idk
 
how
 
the
 
fuck
 
that
 
msg
 
reached
 
me
 
10-15
 
fucking
 
minutes
 
later,
 
after
 
a
 
while
 
again
 
i
 
missed
 
it
 
because
 
whatsapp
 
notified
 
me
 
5-10
 
min
 
later.
 
i
 
miss
 
her
 
so
 
much.
 
i
 
wanted
 
to
 
talk
 
to
 
her
 
before
 
she
 
is
 
gone.
 
watsapp
 
fuckkkkkkkkkkkk
 
youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
 
i
 
was
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
sleep
 
last
 
night,
 
i
 
slept
 
for
 
ig
 
1-1.5
 
hrs,
 
but
 
thats
 
it
 
im
 
awake
 
since
 
2am,
 
took
 
a
 
errand
 
to
 
the
 
park
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
distract
 
myself
 
from
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
i
 
can't
 
talk
 
to
 
her.
 
currently
 
i
 
was
 
on
 
jujutsu
 
kaisen
 
movie
 
but
 
it
 
just
 
cannot
 
hold
 
my
 
attention
 
more
 
than
 
her.
 
i
 
was
 
waiting
 
for
 
her
 
msg
 
since
 
6
 
45,
 
i
 
even
 
bathed
 
before
 
that.
