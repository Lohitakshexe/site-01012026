eternal
 
love?
 
what
 
does
 
that
 
mean?
 
forever,
 
everlasting
 
consistent
 
too?
 
if
 
it
 
does,
 
i
 
am
 
relieved
 
of
 
it
 
because
 
i
 
will
 
love
 
you
 
more,
 
each
 
moment
 
i
 
think
 
of
 
you,
 
each
 
moment
 
you
 
touch
 
me,
 
each
 
and
 
everything
 
reminds
 
me
 
of
 
you
 
what
 
will
 
it
 
be?
 
so
 
important
 
to
 
me
 
all
 
of
 
your
 
care,
 
your
 
heart,
 
your
 
soft
 
emotions
 
my
 
dream,
 
i
 
wrote
 
you,
 
my
 
pages
 
were
 
shy
 
i
 
am
 
so
 
in
 
love,
 
except
 
for
 
you?
 
the
 
queen
 
of
 
hearts
 
none
 
can
 
handle
 
my
 
love
 
i
 
don't
 
have
 
space
 
to
 
be
 
filled,
 
in
 
my
 
heart
 
i
 
have
 
a
 
mould,
 
which
 
only
 
you
 
could
 
suffice
 
my
 
darling,
 
i
 
love
 
you
 
now,
 
now,
 
now......
 
each
 
moment
 
that
 
stands
 
to
 
see
 
me
 
face
