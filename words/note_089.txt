the
 
thing
 
i
 
said
 
yesterday
 
was
 
not
 
at
 
all
 
me
 
suggesting
 
u
 
to
 
do
 
anything
 
of
 
that
 
sort,i
 
just
 
wanted
 
to
 
know
 
how
 
they
 
would
 
react.
 
pls
 
trust
 
me,
 
and
 
i
 
told
 
this
 
to
 
u
 
before
 
saying
 
that
 
too.i
 
myself
 
would
 
never
 
do
 
such
 
a
 
thing,
 
it's
 
a
 
terrible
 
thing
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
a
 
purpose
 
of
 
going
 
out
 
to
 
meet
 
someone/enjoy,
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
worried
 
ofc.i
 
mean
 
i
 
have
 
done
 
it
 
but
 
i
 
was
 
genuinely
 
angry
 
and
 
needed
 
a
 
break
 
and
 
i
 
wad
 
alone
 
at
 
that
 
time
 
and
 
i
 
did
 
not
 
even
 
tell
 
my
 
parents
 
that
 
going
 
out,i
 
simply
 
sneaked
 
out,
 
they
 
found
 
out
 
after
 
a
 
while,
 
just
 
before
 
i
 
came
 
back
