*Happy
 
Birthday

the
 
one
 
and
 
only
 
_mine_
 
!*
 
🎂
♥
 
 
The
 
clock
 
just
 
struck
 
12,
 
which
 
means
 
the
 
world
 
officially
 
gets
 
another
 
year
 
of
 
you......the
 
most
 
annoying,
 
stupidly
 
cute,
 
and
 
ridiculously
 
lovable
 
person
 
I
 
know.
 
😏
 
But
 
let’s
 
not
 
forget
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
part.....you’re
 
officially
 
a
 
year
 
younger
 
than
 
me
 
again.
 
love
 
u
 
But
 
does
 
it
 
even
 
matter?
 
Becuz
 
u
 
r
 
the
 
only
 
person..
 
I
 
literally
 
prayed
 
to
 
god
 
to
 
be
 
mine
