in
 
it,
 
just

u
 
r
 
my
 
eternal
 
love.
 
before
 
all
 
this,
 
i
 
thought
 
I
 
never
 
needed
 
anyone(i
 
was
 
masking
 
the
 
lonliness),
 
and
 
i
 
will
 
die
 
alone
 
playing
 
games
 
online.
 
but
 
then
 
u,
 
u
 
have
 
ignited
 
a
 
spark
 
in
 
me,
 
smth
 
i
 
never
 
knew
 
existed
 
in
 
me.
 
my
 
desires,
 
my
 
wants,
 
u
 
brought
 
them
 
back.
 
i
 
have
 
more
 
to
 
write,
 
but
 
i
 
think
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
go.
 
 
anyways,
 
I'm
 
back
 
and
 
still
 
my
 
head
 
is
 
on
 
in
 
that
 
direction,
 
so
 
yeah,
 
i
 
will
 
write
 
more
 
 
i
 
wouldnt
 
have
 
dated
 
anyone,
 
literally
 
anyone
 
in
 
this
 
world,
 
thats
 
just
 
how
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
after
 
my
 
last
 
relationships,
 
but
 
then
 
u
 
made
 
me
 
feel
 
emotions,
 
i
 
never
 
knew
 
I
 
could
 
be
 
sensitive
 
,
 
my
 
own
 
insensitivity
 
to
 
a
 
few
 
matters
 
agitated
 
me,
 
but
 
u
 
brought
 
me
 
back
 
from
 
literal
 
dead.
 
i
 
love
 
uuuu
 
so
 
ooooo
 
muchhhh
 
darling
 
 
i
 
will
 
stay
 
beside
 
u,
 
no
 
matter
 
the
 
ordeals
 
i
 
will
 
care
 
for
 
u,
 
till
 
I
 
die
 
i
 
will
 
only
 
accept
 
u,
 
and
 
no
 
one
 
else
 
u
 
r
 
my
 
only
 
one,
 
and
 
i
 
will
 
stay
 
with
 
u
 
forever
 
 
my
 
problems,
 
u
 
unraveled
 
them
 
unaware,
 
u
 
dissipated
 
them
 
my
 
love
 
for
 
u,
 
it's
 
sooo
 
deep
 
that
 
no
 
matter
 
the
 
forces,
 
i
 
cannot
 
break
