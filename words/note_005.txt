o
 
my
 
night
 
sky,
 
shining
 
brighter
 
than
 
the
 
Sirius,
 
looking
 
prettier
 
than
 
the
 
constellation,
 
Dexterily
 
drawn
 
by
 
the
 
hands
 
of
 
heavens
 
blinding
 
me,
 
overwhelming
 
me
 
 
such
 
memorizing
 
eyes
 
and
 
beautiful
 
smile
 
u
 
have,
 
for
 
i
 
wanna
 
take
 
a
 
plunge
 
and
 
then
 
drown,
 
for
 
ever
 
and
 
ever
