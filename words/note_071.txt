yesterday,
 
she
 
gave
 
me
 
alot
 
of
 
kisses
 
on
 
the
 
lips
 
and
 
i
 
was
 
just
 
naturally
 
energetic
 
in
 
the
 
evening
 
(had
 
nothing
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
the
 
kisses),
 
to
 
i
 
told
 
her
 
how
 
much
 
i
 
love
 
her,i
 
can
 
never
 
tell
 
her
 
enough,
 
but
 
yea,
 
i
 
did.
 
and
 
I'm
 
thinking,
 
what
 
if
 
she
 
feels
 
that
 
i
 
love
 
her
 
physically
 
and
 
that's
 
all
 
cz
 
i
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
very
 
hearty
 
last
 
few
 
days,
 
yesterday
 
i
 
was
 
and
 
i
 
expressed
 
my
 
love.
 
i
 
love
 
her
 
so
 
oooooo
 
much
 
and
 
i
 
have
 
grown
 
to
 
love
 
her
 
physically
 
too,
 
this
 
does
 
not
 
mean
 
that
 
i
 
just
 
love
 
her
 
physically.
 
her
 
personality
 
was
 
always
 
the
 
best
 
thing
