o
 
my
 
love,
 
your
 
ordeals,
 
i
 
accept
 
burden
 
to
 
me?
 
no,
 
they
 
aren't
 
i
 
discover
 
myself
 
lucky,
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
try
 
and
 
console
 
you
 
to
 
have
 
your
 
back,
 
to
 
try
 
and
 
make
 
u
 
feel
 
protected
 
my
 
love,
 
you
 
are
 
all
 
i
 
want,
 
today
 
and
 
forever,
 
regardless
 
of
 
what's
 
on
 
your
 
mind,
 
i
 
will
 
still
 
love
 
u
 
always
 
and
 
forever
