my
 
lovely
 
queen,
 
o'
 
how
 
it
 
feels
 
in
 
your
 
arms
 
you
 
surround
 
me
 
with
 
comfort,
 
oh
 
god,
 
if
 
i
 
am
 
so
 
comfortable,
 
what
 
is
 
it
 
seek
 
you,
 
my
 
sacred
 
queen,
 
i
 
want
 
something,
 
that
 
is
 
eternal,
 
this
 
emptiness,
 
its
 
is
 
of
 
your
 
company,
 
which
 
i
 
have
 
right
 
now,
 
but
 
even
 
a
 
thought,
 
that
 
this
 
could
 
go
 
down,
 
makes
 
me
 
so
 
uncomfortable
