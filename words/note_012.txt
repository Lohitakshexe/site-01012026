for
 
my
 
last
 
love
 
 
what
 
is
 
she9
 
how
 
is
 
she
 
different9
 
she's
 
just
 
different,
 
i
 
Love
 
her,
 
id
 
like
 
most
 
people,
 
but
 
her,
 
i
 
will
 
bear
 
anyone
 
and
 
everyone,
 
for
 
her.
 
i
 
love
 
her,
 
and
 
i
 
will
 
always
 
love
 
her,
 
like
 
this.
 
i
 
try
 
to
 
make
 
her
 
laugh,
 
amuse
 
her,
 
everytime
 
she
 
laughs,
 
im
 
the
 
one
 
blushing.
 
her
 
soft
 
hands,
 
as
 
if
 
it
 
were
 
a
 
stress
 
toy,
 
but
 
no,
 
this
 
one,
 
not
 
to
 
pressed,
 
but
 
to
 
be
 
felt,
 
calm
 
oneself.
 
importance
 
is
 
not
 
even
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
my
 
allusion
 
to
 
her,
 
her
 
love,
 
made
 
me
 
shine,
 
made
 
me
 
bear
 
things,
 
made
 
me
 
get
 
through
 
things,
 
unscathed,
 
because
 
oh
 
when
 
she's
 
my
 
shield,
 
what
 
demon
 
will
 
not
 
shy
 
way.
 
i
 
will
 
protect
 
her
 
from
 
everything
 
i
 
possibly
 
can,
 
i
 
will
 
be
 
everything
 
for
 
her,
 
everything.
 
how
 
she
 
makes
 
me
 
go
 
crazy
 
and
 
yet
 
calmer,
 
her
 
love
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
medicine,
 
her
 
arms
 
r
 
the
 
best
 
place
 
to
 
be
 
in,
 
her
 
voice
 
is
 
the
 
greatest
 
melody
 
of
 
this
 
universe.
