if
 
it
 
were
 
intimacy,
 
i,
 
for
 
once,
 
who
 
is
 
condemned
 
to
 
not
 
pay
 
attention,
 
would
 
never
 
have
 
had
 
felt
 
enough,
 
to
 
write,
 
to
 
think
 
and
 
smile
 
my
 
hours
 
away
 
it's
 
always
 
been
 
more
 
than
 
touch,
 
it's
 
peace,
 
you
 
are
 
my
 
calm,
 
you
 
are
 
my
 
home
 
it
 
isn't
 
everytime,
 
one's
 
feeling
 
down,
 
to
 
be
 
counseled
 
just
 
to
 
think,
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
one
 
person,
 
who
 
understands,
 
listens,
 
thinks
 
is
 
enough
 
for
 
me
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
smile
 
and
 
walk
 
ahead
 
,not
 
heavy,
 
but
 
light
 
and
 
subtle
