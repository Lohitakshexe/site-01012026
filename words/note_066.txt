she's
 
flame
 
i
 
was
 
seeking
 
and
 
i
 
didn't
 
know
 
important
 
to
 
me?
 
oh
 
she
 
is
 
one
 
as
 
'importance',
 
cannot
 
describe
 
it
 
a
 
'life',
 
maybe
 
could
 
my
 
beautiful,
 
she's
 
the
 
wonder,
 
created
 
with
 
such
 
tenderness,
 
such
 
fine
 
features,
 
eyes,
 
as
 
deep
 
as
 
your
 
love,
 
to
 
be
 
lost
 
in
 
them?
 
i
 
absolutely
 
want
 
to
 
pages
 
fail
 
to
 
be
 
potent
 
enough,
 
lines
 
fail
 
to
 
describe
 
the
 
serenity
 
of
 
hers,
 
not
 
just
 
extraordinary,
 
extravagant
 
as
 
a
 
chandelier,
 
lit
 
up
 
with
 
that
 
glow
 
which
 
fills,
 
even
 
me,
 
with
 
the
 
light
 
unknown
 
to
 
mankind
 
she's
 
the
 
furnace,
 
people
 
don't
 
have,
 
she's
 
the
 
power,
 
people
 
don't
 
have
 
my
 
heart,
 
o'
 
its
 
gone
 
my
 
love,
 
its
 
channeled
 
o'
 
my
 
beautiful,
 
all
 
i
 
can
 
say
 
is,
 
you
 
are
 
the
 
one
 
they
 
write
 
about,you
 
are
 
the
 
one,
 
they
 
adore
 
in
 
their
 
dreamlands
 
o'
 
to
 
live
 
this
 
dream,
 
o'
 
my
 
my,
 
delighted,
 
ecstatic
 
to
 
another
 
height
 
i
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
one
 
who
 
gets
 
to
 
see
 
through
 
you,have
 
you
 
as
 
the
 
light,
 
that
 
will
 
guide
 
me
 
through
 
all
 
i
 
love
 
u
 
shreeya
 
and
 
i
 
just
