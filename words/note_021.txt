the
 
things,
 
abt
 
which,
 
i
 
did
 
not
 
care
 
enough
 
for,
 
but
 
just
 
enjoyed,
 
i,
 
really
 
did
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
liking
 
for
 
them,
 
i
 
did
 
not
 
promptly
 
gave
 
in
 
thoughts
 
there,
 
but
 
whether
 
i
 
tried,
 
i
 
never
 
had
 
it
 
good.
 
it
 
was
 
u,
 
on
 
whom
 
my
 
liking
 
was
 
built.
 
before
 
'us',
 
even
 
when
 
our
 
relationship
 
started,
 
it
 
never
 
occurred
 
to
 
me
 
that,
 
i,
 
will,
 
maybe,
 
kiss
 
u
 
someday.
 
u
 
r
 
really
 
close
 
to
 
my
 
heart
 
baby,
 
i
 
mean
 
it,
 
u
 
r
 
my
 
(almost)
 
everything.
