shreeya,
 
i
 
love
 
u,
 
i
 
truly
 
love
 
uu
 
over
 
the
 
top.
 
last
 
few
 
days,
 
both
 
of
 
us
 
were
 
down,
 
and
 
uk
 
when
 
i
 
made
 
ur
 
mood
 
better
 
yesterday,
 
that
 
was
 
the
 
best
 
feeling
 
i
 
have
 
had
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
days(i
 
drank
 
coffee
 
like
 
crazy,
 
and
 
spotify,
 
twice
 
my
 
default
 
volume),
 
yesterday
 
was
 
such
 
a
 
bad
 
day,
 
it
 
could
 
have
 
been
 
the
 
worst
 
in
 
6months,
 
but
 
then,
 
when
 
i
 
helped
 
u
 
out,
 
it
 
cheered
 
me
 
up
 
and
 
made
 
it
 
a
 
bit
 
above
 
neutral.
 
and
 
*everything
 
i
 
say,
 
is
 
never
 
a
 
bluff,
 
not
 
'never'
 
but
 
really
 
really
 
rare,
 
when
 
it
 
serves
 
as
 
core
 
of
 
humor
 
or
 
smth*.
 
sweetheart,
 
u
 
r
 
the
 
best
 
thing
 
that
 
ever
 
happened
 
to
 
me.
 
fixing
 
ur
 
mood
 
helps
 
me
 
alot
 
more
 
than
 
u
 
fixing
 
my
 
mood
 
could
 
ever
 
will,
 
yes
 
i
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
a
 
state
 
to
 
be
 
helpful
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
but
 
i
 
will
 
always
 
try
 
my
 
best
 
to
 
do
 
that,
 
temporarily
 
like
 
i
 
did.
 
yesterday
 
i
 
got
 
a
 
panic
 
attack,
 
bad
 
one,
 
i
 
partially
 
collapsed
 
on
 
the
 
wall
 
of
 
that
 
silent
 
street.
 
i
 
thought
 
abt
 
u,
 
drank
 
ORS,
 
and
 
managed
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
park
 
somehow,
 
sat
 
there
 
for
 
a
 
while,
 
thinking
 
abt
 
u,
 
it
 
helped
 
me
 
quite
 
alot(ofc
 
it
 
did).
 
u
 
see,
 
u
 
fix
 
me
 
just
 
by
 
existing
 
my
 
love.
 
darling
 
u
 
give
 
it
 
all
 
to
 
me
 
just
 
by
 
breathing,
 
i
 
love
 
u
 
sooo
 
muchhhh.
 
i
 
could
 
have
 
found
 
no
 
one
 
better
 
than
 
u,
 
u
 
r
 
the
 
only
 
person,
 
i
 
would
 
ever
 
romanticize
 
with.
 
cutiee,
 
i
 
could
 
die
 
for
 
anyone,
 
but
 
i
 
will
 
live
 
for
 
u.
