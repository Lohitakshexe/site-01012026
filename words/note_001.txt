not
 
just
 
a
 
star
 
twinkling
 
in
 
the
 
night
 
sky,
 
she's
 
a
 
part,
 
part
 
of
 
me
 
so
 
big,
 
at
 
times,
 
even
 
i
 
myself,
 
am
 
consumed
 
for
 
her
 
love,
 
it
 
is
 
beyond
 
satisfaction
 
every
 
line,
 
every
 
hi
 
every
 
bye,
 
stirrs
 
me
 
to
 
the
 
core
 
never
 
have
 
i
 
ever
 
held
 
anyone,
 
so
 
close
 
to
 
my
 
heart
 
her
 
valour,
 
her
 
calm,
 
doors
 
of
 
my
 
heart,
 
pains
 
of
 
my
 
heart,
 
she
 
opened
 
a
 
long
 
time,
 
before
 
i
 
was
 
hers
 
enought,
 
to
 
tell
 
her
