i
 
love
 
_u_,
 
i
 
really
 
do
 
and
 
i
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
mention,
 
'hugs
 
work
 
great
 
for
 
me
 
too',
 
its
 
not
 
like
 
i
 
m
 
too
 
needy
 
for
 
kisses,
 
i
 
go
 
along
 
with
 
hugs
 
pretty
 
well,
 
they
 
more
 
than
 
*enough*,
 
to
 
if
 
by
 
any
 
chance
 
u
 
feel,
 
i
 
m
 
too
 
needy
 
for
 
kisses,
 
i
 
wanted
 
to
 
mention,
 
i
 
am
 
not.
 
yes
 
alot
 
of,
 
when
 
i
 
flirt,
 
is
 
kissing
 
but
 
i
 
go
 
great
 
with
 
hugs
 
to
 
don't
 
think.....
 
i
 
feel
 
strange
 
its
 
not
 
that
 
big
 
of
 
a
 
deal,
 
u
 
r
 
not
 
thinking
 
anything
 
too
 
obtrusive,
 
and
 
its
 
totally
 
what
 
we
 
r
 
good
 
with.
 
this
 
should
 
all
 
be
 
fine
 
w
 
me,
 
but
 
i
 
still
 
feel
 
strange
 
when
 
i
 
think
 
abt
 
u
 
thinking
 
of
 
me
 
'too
 
needy
 
for
 
kisses',
 
i
 
do
 
love
 
to
 
kiss
 
u,
 
but
 
i
 
love
 
to
 
hugg
 
uu,
 
and
 
those
 
hugs
 
are
 
far
 
more
 
valuable
