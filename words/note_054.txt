my
 
shinny
 
gurl,
 
she
 
is
 
the
 
charm,
 
brightens
 
my
 
day
 
to
 
the
 
core,
 
each
 
day,
 
with
 
her,
 
was
 
so
 
special
 
she
 
dosen't
 
know,
 
she
 
never
 
will
 
she's
 
the
 
conduit,
 
which
 
makes
 
me
 
feel
 
things,
 
makes
 
me
 
hearty
 
all
 
i
 
am,
 
i
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
nurture
 
everything
 
unto
 
her
 
my
 
pretty
 
gurl,
 
everything
 
about
 
her,
 
is
 
yearned
 
by
 
poets,
 
by
 
artists,
 
by
 
a
 
true
 
lover
 
all
 
their
 
miseries,
 
oh
 
i
 
don't
 
know
 
because...
 
i
 
am
 
the
 
one
 
who
 
gets
 
to
 
delight
 
her
