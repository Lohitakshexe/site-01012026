i
 
can
 
never
 
be
 
enough,
 
o
 
she
 
deserves
 
so
 
much
 
more
 
my
 
beloved,
 
i
 
fall
 
for
 
her,
 
each
 
time
 
i
 
look
 
in
 
those
 
eyes,
 
each
 
time
 
i
 
hold
 
her
 
in
 
my
 
arms
 
,
 
each
 
time
 
i
 
kiss
 
those
 
lips,
 
each
 
time
 
i
 
tell
 
her
 
i
 
love
 
her,
 
such
 
a
 
pleasury
 
face
 
she
 
gives
 
me,
 
with
 
words
 
full
 
of
 
hate
 
but
 
o'
 
that
 
language,
 
i
 
adore
 
 
my
 
shiny
 
little
 
piece
 
of
 
cake,
 
i
 
am
 
never
 
letting
 
u
 
go(by
 
myself)
