i
 
feel
 
like
 
crying,
 
i
 
feel
 
so
 
empty.
 
i
 
haven't
 
hug
 
her
 
since
 
4
 
days
 
ig
 
but
 
these
 
four
 
days
 
feel
 
like
 
weeks
 
or
 
months,
 
maybe
 
because
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
time
 
when
 
i
 
need
 
those
 
hugs
 
the
 
most
 
with
 
everything
 
going
 
on,
 
with
 
her
 
and
 
me,
 
both
 
:(
