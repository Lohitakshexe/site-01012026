you
 
are
 
fine
 
as
 
a
 
bow
 
sharp
 
as
 
a
 
blade
 
sweet
 
as
 
a
 
fire
 
and
 
the
 
furnace
 
of
 
all
 
this
 
o,
 
i
 
wonder
 
how
 
you
 
were
 
created
 
was
 
it
 
by
 
the
 
hands
 
of
 
god,
 
or
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
animated
 
from
 
the
 
heaven
 
itself
 
really
 
o
 
really
 
i
 
find
 
all
 
my
 
heaven
 
in
 
you
 
your
 
eyes,
 
i
 
wanna
 
dive
 
in
 
them,
 
never
 
come
 
back
 
i
 
wanna
 
rub
 
your
 
cheeks,
 
and
 
never
 
leave
 
your
 
side
 
i
 
wanna
 
delight
 
you,
 
with
 
all
 
i
 
could
 
possibly
 
imbue
 
as
 
my
 
love
