and
 
listen
 
I
 
know
 
this
 
pain
 
is
 
heavy,
 
and
 
I
 
won’t
 
tell
 
you
 
to
 
ignore
 
it....
 
because
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
can’t.
 
But
 
listen
 
to
 
me,
 
okay?
 
You
 
are
 
not
 
alone
 
in
 
this.
 
Maybe
 
the
 
love
 
you
 
deserve
 
isn’t
 
coming
 
from
 
where
 
it
 
should,
 
but
 
that
 
doesn’t
 
mean
 
ur
 
unloved.
 
and
 
she
 
is
 
ur
 
mother....
 
maybe
 
talk
 
directly
 
to
 
her...
 
this
 
time...
