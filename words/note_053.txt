you
 
are
 
my
 
strength,
 
you
 
are
 
my
 
weakness,
 
my
 
love,
 
i
 
will
 
do
 
anything
 
for
 
you
 
i
 
will
 
travel
 
miles
 
if
 
i
 
have
 
to,
 
just
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
glimpse
 
of
 
that
 
glorious
 
face
 
i
 
can
 
never
 
imagine
 
myself
 
without
 
you,
 
o
 
beautiful,
 
i
 
can
 
never
 
be
 
deserving
 
enough
 
but
 
since
 
you
 
say,
 
i
 
am
 
fine
 
i
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
delight
 
you
 
till
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
time
 
i
 
will
 
love
 
you
 
till
 
the
