not
 
just
 
a
 
person,
 
you
 
are
 
a
 
precious
 
emotion
 
to
 
me
 
you
 
are
 
the
 
maze
 
i
 
am
 
lost
 
in,
 
and
 
i
 
don't
 
ever
 
wanna
 
find
 
my
 
way
 
out
 
i
 
just
 
wanna
 
stumble
 
on
 
the
 
walls
 
like
 
this,
 
and
 
never,
 
ever
 
take
 
a
 
step
 
back
 
i
 
don't
 
certainly
 
know,
 
if
 
i
 
am
 
the
 
one
 
you
 
deserve,
 
your
 
soft
 
skin,
 
addles
 
my
 
judgement
 
o
 
your
 
ocean
 
eyes,
 
let
 
me
 
be
 
one
 
with
 
the
 
waters
 
that
 
i
 
want
 
to
 
adore,
 
for
 
life
 
this
 
sense
 
of
 
completion,
 
like,
 
most
 
of
 
me
 
never
 
was
 
really
 
active,
 
but
 
you,
 
have
 
ignited
 
something,
 
i
 
have
 
looked
 
up
 
to
