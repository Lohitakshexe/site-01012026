love,
 
no
 
one
 
gets
 
me
 
like
 
you
 
do
 
no
 
one
 
makes
 
feels
 
the
 
way
 
you
 
do
 
 
 
o'
 
baby
 
how
 
i
 
will
 
handle
 
you,
 
 
so
 
gently
 
so
 
lovingly
 
like
 
the
 
most
 
fragile
 
piece
 
of
 
glassware,
 
 
but
 
o
 
for
 
this
 
wonderful
 
creation,
 
 
i

have
 
my
 
love
 
 
o
 
when
 
i
 
think
 
about
 
it,
 
 
how
 
i
 
will
 
handle
 
you
 
like
 
the
 
fire,
 
that
 
burns
 
so
 
beautifully,
 
 
but
 
no
 
one
 
dares
 
to
 
caress
 
it
 
to
 
really
 
feel
 
it,
 
but
 
o
 
how
 
i
 
will
 
feel
 
you
 
my
 
precious
 
furnace
 
how
 
i
 
wanna
 
fuel
 
you
