how
 
will
 
everything
 
work
 
out?
 
id
 
wanna
 
say
 
it
 
directly
 
to
 
her
 
but
 
i
 
don't
 
think
 
i
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
focus
 
in
 
class
 
if
 
she
 
is
 
not
 
there.
 
ya,
 
everyone
 
would
 
say
 
"ur
 
head
 
is
 
upside
 
down",
 
but
 
ya
 
tbh
 
i
 
remember
 
those
 
few
 
months
 
when
 
she
 
was
 
not
 
in
 
my
 
coaching,
 
i
 
was
 
totally
 
off
 
balance
 
and
 
did
 
not
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
coaching.
 
why
 
tf
 
can
 
jai
 
sir
 
not
 
be
 
enough
 
for
 
jee
