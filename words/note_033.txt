this
 
is
 
the
 
place
 
where
 
i
 
realised
 
for
 
thefitst
 
time
 
that
 
I
 
m
 
totally
 
in
 
love
 
with
 
u.
 
u
 
smiled,
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
my
 
denial
 
suddenly
 
became
 
my
 
whole
 
reality
 
 
 
you,
 
are
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
space
 
i
 
confide
 
in
 
you
 
are
 
a
 
everlasting
 
passage
 
passage
 
of
 
my
 
time,
 
that
 
showers
 
me
 
with
 
joy,
 
that
 
only,
 
showers
 
me
 
with
 
joy
 
o
 
my
 
love,
 
when
 
i
 
am
 
alone,
 
i
 
feel
 
a
 
essence
 
i
 
am
 
missing
 
out,
 
missing
 
out
 
the
 
true
 
nature
 
of
 
happiness
 
you
 
are
 
my
 
ecstacy
 
you
 
love
 
me,
 
sometimes,
 
seems
 
evident
 
but,
 
is
 
inevident
 
your
 
love,
 
addles
 
me
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
makes
 
me
 
who
 
i
 
am
 
enamored?
 
infatuated?
 
foul
 
head?
 
foolish?
 
i
 
don't
 
know
 
which
 
tutelages
 
me,
 
but
 
i
 
know,
 
for
 
everything
 
in
 
this
 
almost
 
'nothing'
 
world
 
you,
 
are
 
the
 
person,
 
i
 
would
 
never
 
never
 
leave,
 
i
 
would
 
always
 
care
 
for
 
i
 
would
 
always
 
try
 
to
 
be
 
there
 
for
